# Instance Storage

As the name implies, instance storage stores the current widget instance and makes it accessible through a hash string. This feature is useful when you want to access a variable without having it visible in your widgets HTML.

### When Will You Use It?

For example, let's say you create a newsletter widget, and you're adding direct integration with a few newsletter providers. So you add a field that lets your users enter their MailChimp API key for example. You'll need to access this API key only after someone submits a form.

So, instead you'll just include the instance storage hash in your newsletter signup HTML form. You'd then use that hash to retrieve the full instance (including the API key) after a user has submitted the signup form back to your server.

### Enabling Instance Storage

Your widget won't have instance storage enabled by default. You can enable it by setting the `instance_storage` key to true in the `$widget_options` array.

```php
class My_Newsletter_Widget extends SiteOrigin_Widget {
    function __construct() {

        parent::__construct(
            'sow-newsletter',
            __('Newsletter Widget', 'my-plugin'),
            array(
                // Enable instance storage
                'instance_storage' => true,
            ),
            array(

            ),
            array(
                'api_key' => array(
                    'type' => 'text',
                    'label' => __('API Key', 'my-plugin'),
                ),
            ),
            plugin_dir_path(__FILE__)
        );
    }
    
    // Rest of the widget goes here
}
```

The Widgets Bundle will enable instance storage for this specific widget. The Widgets Bundle will automatically cache the instance every time the widget is displayed.

### Using the $storage_hash Variable

If your widget has `instance_storage` enabled, then your widget template files will have access to a variable called `$storage_hash`. You'll normally just add this as a hidden field in your form or as a `data-storage-hash` HTML attribute if you want to send requests using AJAX.

```
<input type="hidden" name="storage_hash" value="<?php echo esc_attr($storage_hash) ?>" />
```

### Retreiving Instance Storage

You're free to handle the user's form details however you want, but you'll need to call `$this->get_stored_instance( $storage_hash );`. The easiest way to handle a request would be to create an [ajax handler](https://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins).

```php
function my_action_callback() {
    // You should do some nonce checking here
    if( empty($_POST['_wp_nonce']) || !wp_verify_nonce( $_GET['_wp_nonce'], 'action' ) ) return;
    
    $widget = new My_Newsletter_Widget;
    $instance = $widget->get_stored_instance( $_POST['storage_hash'] );
    $key = $instance['api_key'];
    
    // Now we can handle the rest of the input from $_POST.
    SomeNewsletterAPI::signup( $key, $_POST['email'] );
    
    // Either die or redirect the user to a success page
    wp_die();
}
add_action( 'wp_ajax_my_action', 'my_action_callback' );
```

You're not limited to using instance storage in this specific way though. Once you enable it, you'll be able to store the hash and retrieve the $instance wherever and whenever you please.
